\title{sample size calculation in one-sample log-rank test}
\usage{
SampleSize(alpha = 0.05, power, ta, tf, m0, delta, k = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{type I error rate, by default alpha = 0.05}

\item{power}{the desired power for the study you are planning}

\item{ta}{length of accrual period, during which patients are recruited}

\item{tf}{length of follow-up time, during which patients are monitored}

\item{m0}{median survival time of the standard population or historical control, which can be obtained from previous literature or estimated directly from the standard population.}

\item{delta}{hazard ratio between the sample of interest and the standard population or historical control.}

\item{k}{shape parameter of survival functions (by default k = 1), can be obtained from the standard population or historical control.}
}
\value{
sample size in one-sample log-rank test, depends on the desired power
}
\description{
calculate sample size in one-sample log-rank test
}
\examples{
SampleSize(alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, ta = 5, tf = 3, m0 = 9, delta = 1/1.75, k = 1.22), the result is 88.

The statistical methods used in this package and the examples mentioned in this document are based on methods and examples described in Wu, 2015.
