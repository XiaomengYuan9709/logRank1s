\title{empirical type I error and power}
\usage{
Simulation(n, parameter, B = 1000, k = 1, delta, m0, ta, tf)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size}

\item{parameter}{logical value, if TRUE then calculate empirical alpha, if FALSE calculate empirical power}

\item{B}{number of iterations used in simulation (by default B = 1000)}

\item{k}{shape parameter of survival functions (by default k = 1) from the standard population or historical control}

\item{delta}{hazard ratio between the sample of interest and the standard population or historical control}

\item{m0}{median survival time of the standard population or historical control}

\item{ta}{length of accrual period, during which patients are recruited}

\item{tf}{length of follow-up time, during which patients are monitored}
}
\value{
empirical type I error or empirical power in one-sample log-rank test

\description{
